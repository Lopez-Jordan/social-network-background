# Social BackEnd

Check out the walkthrough video I made! [Click Here!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PAQJv1x1JSeKotgrwEvJR5W8Tc587o74/view)

## Description
In this project, I made a mock application that is similar to many popular social media apps like Instagram, Facebook etc. I utilized my recently aquired skills of MongodDB with the Mongoose ODM! Here I made CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations in conjunction with my models: `User`, which has many `Thought` where each `Thought` has many `Reaction`.

## Installation
All you need to install is insomnia to test the provided routes and all the dependencies listed in the package JSON. Then run `npm start` in order to start the server!
